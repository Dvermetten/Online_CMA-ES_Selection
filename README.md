# Online CMA-ES Selection

This repository contains the code and data required to reproduce the experiments described in the paper "Online Selection of CMA-ES Variants", as well as additional interesting figures and results not included in the publication.

## Structure
This repository consists of three seperate folders, containing the python code used to run the experiments; the notebook used to process the data and part of the data required to use the notebook. 

Data for section 5.2 is available here:
https://surfdrive.surf.nl/files/index.php/s/mkDpa0IFADbetRC

Other data referenced in the notebook can be made available upon request, but is not included here because of its large size.

## Requirements
To run the code, python 2.7 is required, with the packages mentioned in the requirements file installed. 

To run the notebook, Jupyter notebooks running a version of python 3 is required.  The nbextensions package (which can be found [here](https://github.com/ipython-contrib/jupyter_contrib_nbextensions)) is highly recommended for easier reading.

The following extensions in particular are recommended:

    -Initialization cells
    -Collapsable Headings
    -(some) LaTeX environments for Jupyter
    -Table of Contents (2)
